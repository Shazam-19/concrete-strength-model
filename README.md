# concrete-strength-model
A neural network model using the deep learning Keras library for predicting concrete strength and testing different network parameters.

Final project of [Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

This project uses 4 classification algorithms and compares their evaluation to find the best one:
- **

I got a full grade of 20/20 after my _peers_ in the course reviewed my submission which matched the required points were given in the description of the project.
